***Flappy-Server is still in early development and might produce unexpected behavior in the population of birds.***

Learning about Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks by playing Flappy Bird!    
This C# console application should run along side the flappy bird game from here:  
https://github.com/Flappy-Bird-Evolution/Flappy-Game/releases/tag/v1.0  
Inside the server project, navigate to the NeuralNetwork assembly, where you'll find a folder called GeneticOperators with a file, GeneticOperators.cs inside it.
the file has 3 functions:  
`Selection`  
`Crossover`  
`Mutation`  

These are the 3 basic genetic operators one can use  to evolve a genetic population.  
Edit these 3 functions to evolve the population of flappy birds!
